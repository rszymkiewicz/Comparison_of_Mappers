# Mapping
## What is Mapping? 
Mapping is a key step in the analysis of sequence samples. One method of mapping is utilizing a reference sequence in order to align reads generated by NGS sequencers to a reference genome. Mapping can be performed using single-end or paired-end reads. 

In the case of our sample set we have reads which were sequenced by Illumina as paired-ends therefore; when utilizing bioinformatic mapper tools we will use the paired-end parameters.  

## Bioinformatic Tools for Mapping
We will use a two commonly used bioinformatic mapping tools which both utilize the Burrows-Wheeler Transform algorithm:
1. Bowtie2
2. BWA

## Lets perform mapping of our reads from our samples using [Bowtie2](https://github.com/rszymkiewicz/Comparison_of_Mappers/blob/master/7_Mapping_Bowtie2.md) bioinformatic software tool first.
