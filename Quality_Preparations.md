# Quality Preparation of Whole Genome Sequences

Checking for good quality sequences is the first component of sequence analysis. Quality checking can be performed through the evaluation of raw sequences. To do this, programs can identify potential areas of uncertainty specifically surrounding both the sequencer (equipment error) and the library material (human error) which may have contributed to the final error rate. It is essential to investigate the quality of the sequences prior to analysis as the biological outcomes will be affected by each step of analysis beginning with the raw sample. 

In order to begin sequence analysis with the highest sample quality possible, one must first assess the sequences and performing trimming of inappropriate components such as library material and low quality reads. The FastQC software tool is a great starting tool to identify potential areas of uncertainity within the sequence sample.
