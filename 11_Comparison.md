# Data Comparison

## Objective of this Project
***Goals of Comparison***
## Tools Used for Comparison


## Now that we have combined all the identified the regions of alignment between our sample and reference sequence, lets dive deeper and compare the results of our two mapping tools (Bowtie2 and BWA) using [vcftools and bedtools](https://github.com/rszymkiewicz/Comparison_of_Mappers/blob/master/12_Comparison_vcftools_bedtools.md) to see if we obtained different results.
